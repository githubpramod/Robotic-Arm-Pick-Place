# Robotic-Arm-Pick-Place
# Introduction 

This project uses a [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/#features) simulation platform to program a 
[Kuka KR210](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/robotics-systems/industrial-robots/kr-210-2-f-exclusive) 
6 degree of freedom serial manipulator to pick up a cylinder from a shelf and drop it into a bin next to 
the manipulator.

The cylinder is located radnomly on the shlef, Thus the robot needs to figure out his motor and joint angles 
and speeds to reach to the can from Global reference frames to his local frames. This could be acheived by 
calculaing the inverse Kinematics of the Robot.

## Kinematic Analysis

*Kinematics*  is the a branch of mechanics that describes the motion of a system without considering the forces involved. 
After evaluating the the kr210.urdf.xacro, and comparing it with our DH parameter reference frames, we converted the Robot 
dimension information to the DH table as the following.

![dh parameter reference frame]
 ![alt text][image4]

 Links | alpha(i-1)(rad) | a(i-1)(m) | d(i)(m) | theta(i)(rad)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.33 + 0.42= 0.75 | q1
1->2 | - pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | -pi/2 + q2
2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3
3->4 |  - pi/2 | 0 | 0.96 + 0.54=1.5 | q4
4->5 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q5
5->6 | - pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q6
6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0.193 + 0.11 = 0.303 | 0

2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, individual transformation matrices were created about each joint. 
   In addition, also a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link was generated using only 
   end-effector(gripper) pose
   
Python was used to create the individual transformation matrices about each joint, a snippet of the code is shown:

### Create symbols for joint variables to use in DH table
q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6, q7 = symbols('q1:8')
d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7 = symbols('d1:8')
a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 = symbols('a0:7')
alpha0, alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, alpha6 = symbols('alpha0:7')


# Dictionary (associative array) DH Parameters table, q is theta
s = {alpha0:        0, a0:      0, d1:  0.75,
     alpha1:    -pi/2, a1:   0.35, d2:     0, q2: -pi/2+q2,
     alpha2:        0, a2:   1.25, d3:     0,
     alpha3:    -pi/2, a3: -0.054, d4:   1.5,
     alpha4:     pi/2, a4:      0, d5:     0,
     alpha5:    -pi/2, a5:      0, d6:     0,
     alpha6:        0, a6:      0, d7: 0.303, q7: 0,}

#### Homogeneous Transforms of neighbouring links
T0_1 = Matrix([[             cos(q1),            -sin(q1),            0,              a0],
               [ sin(q1)*cos(alpha0), cos(q1)*cos(alpha0), -sin(alpha0), -sin(alpha0)*d1],
               [ sin(q1)*sin(alpha0), cos(q1)*sin(alpha0),  cos(alpha0),  cos(alpha0)*d1],
               [                   0,                   0,            0,               1]])
T0_1 = T0_1.subs(s)
~~~

this gives the output:

~~~

###Notice becuse of the Gripper's reference frame has the same orientation as joint6
(the one before it) the transformation matrix in the rotation part is the identity matrix.

##From-Base Link to End-Effector Transformation Matrix
To Determine the complete homogeneous transform between the _base link and the gripper link_ (end-effector) using just the end-effector pose (position ==(Px,Py,Pz)==+rotation ==(Roll-Pitch-Yaw== angles of the end-effector)).

~~~
T BL_EE =
⎡               Px ⎤  
⎢                  ⎥  
⎢      RT       Py ⎥  
⎢                  ⎥  
⎢               Pz ⎥  
⎢                  ⎥  
⎣0     0   0    1  ⎦
~~~
Where RT (Rotation transform) can be the result of the intrinsic rotations of the end gripper around the given roll, pitch, yaw angles=`Rx(rol)*Ry(yaw)*Rz(pitch)`.  
**Note**: this gives the same result of ` T6_G` after substituting the Theta angles the Kuka210

~~~
T BL_EE =
⎡               Px ⎤  
⎢                  ⎥  
⎢      RT       Py ⎥  
⎢                  ⎥  
⎢               Pz ⎥  
⎢                  ⎥  
⎣0     0   0    1  ⎦
~~~

Substituting the Thetas with Zeros gives the cumulative distance of the robot from Base Link to End Effector:

~~~
T_EE=
[ 1.0,   0,   0, 2.153],
[   0, 1.0,   0,     0],
[   0,   0, 1.0, 1.946],
[   0,   0,   0,     1]]

##Inverse Kinametics

Inverse Kinematics is computing the joint angles when knowing the end effector's position and orientation. 
Therefore, when knowing the target location, IK computes the amount of movement and direction that needs to 
be executes to reach that location, making it an important chapter in Robotics.

Because the [Kuka KR210](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/robotics-systems/industrial-robots/kr-210-2-f-exclusive) 
joints (4  5 and 6) satisfies that its:  
**Three neighboring joint axes intersect at a single point**

The inverse Kinematic problem it is solvable in closed-form with wrist center at joint _5_.  
which is able to rotate the end effector to the exact orientation required for the task at hand. 
The first three joints move the wrist center to a position where it has enough mobility to orient itself to the angle required.  

## Test Code

The inverse kinematic code was tested with the [IK_debug.py](IK_debug.py) file. it tests the code against known solutions.
Finally, the [IK_server.py]() file contains the code that links into the ROS/Gazebo/Rviz simulator.

### Running the Simulator

To run the [IK_server.py](IK_server.py) code, copy this Pick&Drop code. Then change the inverse kinematics flag to `false`.
To launch the simulator, run: first you need to run 

$cd ~/catkin_ws/
$catkin_make
$./src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/scripts/safe_spawner.sh

You should see both Gazebo and Rviz launching. Gazebo should have a living room environment with the arm, bookshelf, 
bin and blue can all visible. Rviz should have the same, along with text above the scene indicating its status.

To run the inverse kinematic code, run the following code in a new terminal:
$rosrun kuka_arm IK_server.py

You must now press `Next` in the Rviz window to have each step proceed. If everything worked, the arm should eventually 
move to pick up the can, grab it, then move so the arm will drop the can into the bin on the ground.
